```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num1, num2;
    char again;

    while (again == 'y' || again == 'Y')
        cout << "Enter a number: ";
        cin >> num1;
        cout << "Enter another number: ";
        cin >> num2;
        cout << "Their sum is << (num1 + num2) << endl;
        cout << "Do you want to do this again? ";
        cin >> again;
    return 0;
}
```

First error is at the `while`. There are no curly brackets. 

The next error is during the sum. The user forgot to terminate the string literal, messing up the rest of the code. 

Corrected code is as follows:

```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int num1, num2;
    char again;

    while (again == 'y' || again == 'Y'){
        cout << "Enter a number: ";
        cin >> num1;
        cout << "Enter another number: ";
        cin >> num2;
        cout << "Their sum is" << (num1 + num2) << endl;
        cout << "Do you want to do this again? ";
        cin >> again;
    }
        
    return 0;
}

```
