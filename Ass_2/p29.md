```cpp
#include iostream
using namespace std;
int main();
}
    int a, b,c
    a = 3
    b = 4
    c = a+b
    Cout < "The value of c is %d" < C;
    return 0;
{
```
Things that are wrong:
- `#include iostream` should be `#include <iostream>`
- `int main();` should be `int main()`
- `}` should be `{`
- `int a, b, c` should be `int a, b, c;`
- `a = 5` should be `a = 5;`
- `b = 4` should be `b = 4;`
- `c = a + b` should be `c = a + b;`
- `Cout < "The value of c is %d" < C;` should be `cout << "The value of c is " << c << endl;`
- `{` should be `}`
